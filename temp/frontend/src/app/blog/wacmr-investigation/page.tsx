                The Weighted Average Call Money Rate — WACMR —
                is the interest rate at which scheduled Indian banks lend each
                other money overnight, settled on the books of the Reserve Bank
                of India. Conceptually it is a single number, published daily,
                that answers the question: how much is it costing Indian banks to be short of cash tonight?
              </DropCap>
              <p>
                That sounds esoteric, but it is the sharpest thermometer we have
                of monetary-policy transmission. The RBI chooses a policy stance
                and publishes a repo rate. The WACMR is where that stance
                actually has to clear against banks&apos; liquidity needs and
                the interbank market&apos;s demand for cash. If the RBI cuts the
                repo rate and WACMR doesn&apos;t follow, policy is not
                transmitting. If the RBI holds but the WACMR drifts low, the
                system is sloshing with liquidity. The gap between the two —
                the <code>WACMR – Repo</code> spread — is the market&apos;s
                honest opinion of the policy stance.
              </p>

                <li>Frame a forecasting problem — predict the WACMR one week ahead.</li>
                <li>Understand the structure — is the series one stable process, or several?</li>
                <li>
                  Make the result useful — let a researcher (or a reviewer, or a
                  curious economist) interrogate the model.

              <p>
                A good forecast for an overnight rate needs three kinds of data:
                (a) <strong>policy-rate</strong> signals from the central bank,
                (b) <strong>liquidity and balance-sheet</strong> variables from
                the banking system, and (c){" "}
                <strong>market-clearing prices</strong> from adjacent markets
                (T-bills, commercial paper, repo, forex). We pulled eight
                datasets from the{" "}

                The NDAP API is paginated (500 rows per page) and required a

                we added two Yahoo Finance series — the Nifty 50 equity index
                and USD/INR — and a hand-curated list of 75 RBI policy events
                between 2014 and 2024 with manual sentiment scores, so we could
                see whether news adds real lift beyond the quantitative
                features.

              <p>
                The RBI publishes most series weekly, but with inconsistent
                reference dates — some as-of Friday, some as-of the Wednesday
                prior, some as of the last Friday of the prior week. Yahoo
                Finance prices are daily. Our policy events are irregular.
                Before we could feed the data to any model we had to pick a
                single temporal grid and commit to it.
              </p>
              <p>
                We chose <strong>Friday close</strong> as the canonical weekly
                timestamp. Daily series were last-observation-carried-forward
                (LOCF) onto the Friday grid; weekly series were reindexed and
                forward-filled only when the gap was ≤ 1 week (otherwise the
                slot was left <code>NaN</code> and flagged). Technical
                indicators (MACD, TSI, SuperTrend, Bollinger squeeze) were
                computed on the daily data and then sampled at Friday close,
                not the other way around — this keeps indicator semantics
                intact.

              <p>
                Before fitting a forecasting model it&apos;s worth asking: is
                this series one stable process, or does it switch between
                states? A casual look at the chart above suggests the latter —
                the pre-COVID and post-COVID periods feel qualitatively
                different. We wanted a data-driven answer.
              </p>
              <p>
                We standardised every numeric feature, ran PCA to retain 90% of
                variance, then K-Means clustering on the reduced coordinates
                with a silhouette sweep over <code>k = 2…7</code>. The
                silhouette peaked cleanly at <strong>k = 2</strong>, with a
                single transition at <strong>2020-03-06</strong> — the week
                that the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic. K-Means did not know
                about the pandemic. It found it in the data.

                Two observations make this interesting beyond the obvious COVID
                narrative. First, the post-COVID regime outlasted the pandemic:
                the RBI held rates low well into 2022 even as headline CPI
                inflation rose, and the cluster structure reflects that

                <em>not</em> produce a return to the earlier regime — rate
                levels rose but the broader system behaviour (liquidity
                posture, market-repo rates, term-premium structure) stayed in
                Regime 0.

                We chose XGBoost — a gradient-boosted tree ensemble — for the
                forecasting model. The motivation wasn&apos;t raw performance;
                it was <strong>interpretability</strong>. XGBoost trees are
                additive, and SHAP decomposes any prediction into per-feature
                contributions in closed form. For a research artefact that has
                to answer <em>why did the model say that</em>, that matters
                more than a fractional RMSE win from a deep net.

                The most useful thing a forecasting model can do, for a

                perturbs the repo rate (and its downstream lags and spreads),

                averages the predictions to smooth out XGBoost&apos;s tree
                quantisation, and returns the response with a 90% confidence

                A few observations from playing with the simulator. First,
                small perturbations (±25 bps) produce small predicted moves —
                the top feature (last week&apos;s WACMR) doesn&apos;t change
                under the counterfactual, so the model is somewhat sluggish.
                Second, the response is asymmetric: cuts produce larger
                predicted drops than hikes produce rises, consistent with the
                post-COVID regime learning that accommodation transmits more
                quickly than tightening. Third, the 90% CI is wide relative to
                the central estimate — this is honest; the residual
                distribution is what it is.

                  <strong>Only 545 observations.</strong> Even with 10 years of
                  weekly data, we have a small sample for any model that wants
                  to capture regime-dependent dynamics. A daily-frequency
                  version would five-fold the sample and reveal intra-week
                  liquidity dynamics the weekly grid hides.

                <li>
                  <strong>Two regimes may be too few.</strong> A Hidden Markov
                  Model with soft assignments and k ≥ 3 would let us describe
                  the 2022 tightening as its own transient state rather than
                  force it into Regime 0.

                <li>
                  <strong>The counterfactual is not causal.</strong> A real
                  policy analysis would need an instrumented decision, ideally
                  with high-frequency event-study methods around MPC
                  announcements.
                </li>

                  <strong>No live data.</strong> The dashboard is static
                  against the July 2024 snapshot. Wiring up a weekly NDAP
                  refresh + retraining job is straightforward but wasn&apos;t
